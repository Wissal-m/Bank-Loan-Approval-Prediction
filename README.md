# Bank-Loan-Approval-Prediction

This project aims to predict the approval status of bank loans using various machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Classifier (SVC), and Logistic Regression.  
The purpose of this project is to develop a predictive model to determine whether a bank loan application will be approved or rejected. This can help banks automate the loan approval process, saving time and resources.  
The dataset used for this project contains various features related to loan applications, such as annual income, loan amount, cibil score... The target variable is loan_status, which indicates whether the loan was approved (1) or rejected (0).
